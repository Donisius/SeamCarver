# SeamCarver

Using the dual-gradient energy function, the program calculates the energy of each pixel in the picture relative to other pixels. It then removes a path of pixels containing the least amount of energy vertically (from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row) or horizontally (from left to right with one pixel in each row).
